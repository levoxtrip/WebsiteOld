                “Im Bann des Waldmenschen” True Crime Outdoor Tour transforms regional history into an engaging, interactive experience for curious and adventous audiences.
                Combining innovative learning methods with the thrill of outdoor adventure, “Im Bann des Waldmenschen” integrates educational storytelling, diverse riddles, and cutting-edge technology to create a unique and immersive experience.
                <br><br>
                Set in 1967 Osnabrück, the tour draws participants into a gripping investigation. A wave of burglaries and a murder have shaken the city, and the suspect, Bruno F., was arrested on February 24, 1967.
                But now, during his trial, it’s becoming clear that the evidence may not be enough to convict him.
                With time running out, it’s up to the participants to assist the police in gathering the final clues that will ensure justice is served.
                <br><br>
                Participants are equipped with an Android tablet featuring GPS tracking, guiding them through the experience.
                As they approach each designated location, the tablet automatically triggers the next chapter of the story, revealing new clues, challenges, and interactive content that deepen the narrative. This seamless integration of location-based technology ensures that the adventure unfolds dynamically, immersing players further into the plot as they progress through each station.
                <br>
                <br>
                To create a captivating and immersive narrative, I created a variety of riddle mechanics that challenge participants in different ways, making each stop along the journey feel fresh and engaging.
                Each riddle is created to deepen the storyline and provide new perspectives on the unfolding plot.
                Each station combines visual, auditory, and tactile elements, ensuring diverse puzzle dynamics.
                <br><br>
                The tours integrate advanced augmented reality with image detection to trigger riddle logics and accurately place 3D objects in the environment. Players use their devices to scan specific markers or clues, activating hidden puzzles and animations that respond to their actions. This dynamic interaction turns the surroundings into an evolving landscape, where solving each challenge propels the story forward and deepens the immersion.
