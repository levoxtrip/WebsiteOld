                <p> Due to the corona pandemic, digital cultural areas are becoming more relevant. The resulting events, however, differ greatly from ‘normal’ cultural events and must be thought and implemented differently.
                    Our project is a digital art exhibition that uses the opportunities of the digital room to create an alternative to the existing solutions.
                </p>
                    <p>In the shift space, users can explore the works of various artists by moving and looking around almost like in real life. The gallery comprises ten rooms in which nine artists are exhibited.
                    But that's not all. In order to enhance the experience of a typical analogue art exhibition we used the opportunities of the digital room. Above all, the change in the physics and space of the exhibition as well as the direct intervention in the movement and field of vision of the user enable the new experience a traditional exhibition couldn’t create. In the course of the gallery visit, these interventions increase and thus maintain the tension. In addition, the project is designed to be interactive so that viewers can influence the gallery and the works through their movement and behavior.
                    The project was developed in Unity. Individual works of art and models were designed in Cinema4D and Blender. The gallery can be visited for free on <a class="textLink" href="https://shiftspace.online/" > www.shiftspace.online</a> in the browser.
                </p>
                <p>We curated a selection of the artists works for the exhibition ourselves as part of the project. If the user is interested in further works by the artists
                     there is the option of being forwarded directly to the artist's Instagram accounts.
                    The project was be disseminated via social media and was published in August 2020.
